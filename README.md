# Hierarchical-Clustering
Algorithm  Agglomerative clustering works in a “bottom-up” manner. That is, each object is initially considered as a single-element cluster (leaf). At each step of the algorithm, the two clusters that are the most similar are combined into a new bigger cluster (nodes). This procedure is iterated until all points are member of just one single big cluster (root) (see figure below).  The inverse of agglomerative clustering is divisive clustering, which is also known as DIANA (Divise Analysis) and it works in a “top-down” manner. It begins with the root, in which all objects are included in a single cluster. At each step of iteration, the most heterogeneous cluster is divided into two. The process is iterated until all objects are in their own
